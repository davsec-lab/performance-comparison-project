# Evaluating performance of C and Rust

C and Rust are both systems programming languages designed for performance, but they differ significantly in safety guarantees, abstractions, and tooling. As Rust adoption grows in critical infrastructure, it's important to understand how it compares to C in practical performance scenarios. To that end, we aim to use a set of micro-benchmarks to explore their relative performance characteristics.
